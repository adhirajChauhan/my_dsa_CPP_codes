//Time complexitie
//time taken by algo to run 
//as a function of length of input

//Why - asked in interview
//making better programs
//comparision of algo

//cant judge algo by running on fast or slow machine, need to cgeck the big O

//Big O - upper bound - represent the worst case, things cannot get worse than this
//Theta - average case
//Omega - lower bound - best case

//constant time - O(1) //loops working for fixed iteration like going from 1 to 10
//Linear time - O(n) looping n times
//Logarithmic time - O(logn)
//quadratic timr - O(n^2) nested loop
//cubic - 3 loops
// also show two loops seperately for O(n+m)




//then show the complexity table shown in video from least to high
//then solve the question given in video
//lower degree and constants are ignored
//video and charts TLE time limit exceeded
