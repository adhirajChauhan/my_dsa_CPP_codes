/*
The term "Polymorphism" is the combination of "poly" + "morphs" which means many forms
e.g a single person is behaving differently according to the situations.


Polymorphism -> Compile time -> Function Overloading and operator overloading
                Run time -> Virtual function


                Compile time - The overloaded functions are invoked by matching the type and number of arguments. This information is available at the compile time and, therefore, compiler selects the appropriate function at the compile time. It is achieved by function overloading and operator overloading which is also known as static binding or early binding.


                -------After this explain function overloading and operator overloading
