/*

- draw array LL stack and queue and show linear Data structure
- we can use diff DS for diff purpose, some parameter are
    - What needs to be stored
    - Cost of operation
    - Memory usage
    - Ease of implementation

- Show tree(non linear DS) example of company - CEO, CTO, Manager, Employee
- Draw diagram of tree and show root, link, leaf(which do not have child), child-parent relationship,  siblings(have same parent)

- trees are unidirectional, cant go from child to parent

- for a tree with n nodes, there will be n-1 links

- depth of x = length of path from root to x or number of edges in path from root to x

- height of x = number of edges in the longest path from x to a leaf

- height of tree = height of root node


- BINARY TREE

- a tree in which each node can have at most 2 children
- draw a BT in form of data left and right feild
